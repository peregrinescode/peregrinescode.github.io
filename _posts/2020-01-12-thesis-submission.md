I'm very pleased to say my thesis has been submitted.

Next comes the viva!

I kept track of my word count using a small bit of [python code](https://github.com/peregrinescode/TeXcountLogger) I wrote whilst procrastinating.

<div class="scaled">{% include thesisWordCount.html %}</div>

The interactive graph was made using python and [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/).
