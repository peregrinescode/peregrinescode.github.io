The conference is one of the biggest in the field, and was held in Berlin. It was great fun, particularly because <a href="https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/privitera" target="_top">Alberto</a>, <a href="https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/kaienburg" target="_top">Pascal</a>, and I stayed in house boat on the River Spree.
