I got the chance to present my work one final time in 2019 in Yokohama, Japan.

The talk entitled <em>Energy Levels in molecular doping of organic semiconductors</em> was essentially a summary of my PhD thesis.

The conference was great, with seminar sessions covering a wide range of materials research.

During the breaks, there was a good view of the Tokyo bay area to enjoy with a coffee.
