<p>R Warren <em>et al.</em></p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>The device you are using to access this website, the machine this website is hosted on, and all the bits in between are only possible because of digital electronics based on inorganic semiconductors.</p>

<p>One of the key steps toward this digital revolution was control over the semiconductorâ€™s energy levels as well as the Fermi Level.</p>

<p>Similar control has yet to be shown for organic semiconductors.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>By combining doping with energy level tuning, we gain control over the Fermi Level as well as the energy levels in a ternary blend of organic semiconductors. Furthermore, we show that the tuning effect on the dopantâ€™s energy levels must also be considered to fully understand the doping process in organic semiconductors.</p>

<p>We present a statistical model in which the energy levels of all molecules shift dependent on the blend composition. This electrostatic shift is mediated via interactions between the quadrupole moments of the host and dopant molecules.
The model is tested using photothermal deflection spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. The experimental measurements are found to be in good agreement with the model.</p>
