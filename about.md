I'm Ross, a PhD student based at Oxford University studying condensed matter physics. My research focuses on improving the electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors via doping so that we may fabricate better solar cells, light-emitting diodes and field-effect transistors.

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdfs/CV-RossWarren.pdf) (last updated: 6 May 2020).
